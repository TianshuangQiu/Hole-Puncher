# Hole-Puncher
This project aims to convert a string to an image, and then "interfere" with it. 
~~The current method is to insert white 
holes into the image, like taking a hole puncher to a piece of paper.~~

This has been replaced by the method of systematically rolling for a percentage and changing
the pixel color to the background if it falls within this threshold.
